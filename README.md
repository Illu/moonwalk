A simple way to stay up to date with upcoming space launches, built with [React-Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native), using the [Launch Library 2](https://thespacedevs.com/) and the [Spaceflight News API](https://spaceflightnewsapi.net/).

## Installation

If you want to test the app on a simulator running locally, follow these instructions:

First, you'll need to create or import a `GoogleService-Info.plist` file in the `ios` folder. Next, use the following commands:

```bash
$ cd moonwalk

$ yarn

$ cd ios && pod install && cd ..

$ yarn build-ios

$ react-native run-ios
```

### Android

I don't plan to release an Android version of Moonwalk at the current time.

<!-- Although not deployed on the Google Play Store yet, the app is able to run on Android devices. To run the app, simply use the `react-native run-android` command. (This is an ongoing feature, expect some layout issues). -->

## Contribute

If you find a bug, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

New ideas are always welcome, if you have an idea to change or add a feature, let me know by opening an issue or messaging me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MaximeNory).

## Standalone Build

```bash
$ yarn build-ios
```

To see the assets (Images) in your build, open the XCode project, right click on the moonwalk target -> "Add files to Moonwalk" -> select the asset folder, and make sure the 'create folder references' checkbox is ticked.

You should be able to build the app with âŒ˜(cmd)+B.
